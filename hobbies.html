   <h3> <pre> 
               Hey, I have recently joined <b>IIIT Bhopal </b>, an educational institute of national importance.<br>
     During the JEE preparation, I was specially interested in physics. Since my childhood, mathematics is my favourite subject. 
     That is responsible for getting me this college.After solving problems of these two subjects, I realised one of my hobby is problem solving.<br>
     Since the time I first learnt coding, even the simple codes of html, it seemed to me as my natural interest.
     This contributes as my second hobby. <br>
             Now, sometimes in my schhol days when I was asked about my hobbies I used to say that my hobby is reading story books.
     I thought reading books is my hobby but now I have realised that it is the story part in which I am interested in.
     Nowadays I am so much fond of movies specially crime thriller ones. That makes me realise that story consumption is my very 
     old hobby. This makes my third hobby. <br>
             I think hobbies are not made in a day, but one day a thing becomes a hobby.What left is the life of our nation.
     All the indians have cricket as their hobby, so followed by me as well. <br>
     I am still exploring and learning new things in my life.So, I am still counting my hobbies.....
